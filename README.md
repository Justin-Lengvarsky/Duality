# Duality

This project is a submission for the HubSpot Themes Challenge 2021 Hackathon. This submission acts as a collection of landing pages and support pages for Hubspot's CMS marketplace. I developed everything except for the Three.js orb on the front page.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Hubl (HubSpots templating language), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Three.js

Duality's drag and drop/customization functionality comes from Hubl, which also controls the spacing and layout of each page. The 3D orb on the fron page was created with Three.js, and any functionality (the mobile navigation bar and the map) were created using jQuery and JavaScript. 

## Lessons Learned:

This contest taught me how to be comfortable diving into a new technology. There aren't too many outside resources on Hubl or HubSpots environment, so I really had to disect the documentation. As a result I've become more confident in relying on Documentation and using the DOM to style my web pages. Overall it was a great expereince that accelerated my coding skills. I certainly plan on competing in another hackathon in the future!
